      <h1>Spartan Mule</h1>
      <h2>The packing list for minimalists</h2>
      <p>
        Spartan Mule is your personal packing assistant. When you join the Spartan
        Mule community, you will meet your new best friend, Sparty! Sparty, like most
        packing mules, is capable of hauling hundreds of pounds of his companions'
        necessities across the globe. Also like most mules, Sparty is quite stubborn.
        So what separates Sparty from the rest? Well, he's a minimalist. Sure, he 
        CAN haul enough of your supplies to ride out the rest of your life in an abandoned
        bomb shelter at the first sign of a zombie attack (wait...didn't you say you
        were just going to Cabo??) but he doesn't WANT to. Sparty will organize and 
        keep track of the supplies you use the most during your trip. He'll also
        help you ditch the supplies that typically go unused to prevent overpacking
        in the future!
